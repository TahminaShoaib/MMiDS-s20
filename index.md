## About

This course on the **mathematics of data** has several intended audiences:

- *For math majors:* it is meant as an invitation to data science from a mathematical perspective.

- *For (mathematically-inclined) students in data science (undergrad or grad):* it can serve as a mathematical companion to machine learning and statistics courses.

Content-wise it is a **second course** in **linear algebra, probability and vector calculus** illustrated on **data science applications**. 
While the emphasis will be on the mathematical concepts and proofs, students are expected to learn the programming language [Julia](https://julialang.org/).
