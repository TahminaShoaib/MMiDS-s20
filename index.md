## MATH 535: Mathematical Methods in Data Science

*Instructor:* [Sebastien Roch](http://www.math.wisc.edu/~roch/), Department of Mathematics, University of Wisconsin-Madison

*Term:* Spring 2020

### About

This course on the **mathematics of data** has several intended audiences:

- *For math majors:* it is meant as an invitation to data science from a mathematical perspective.

- *For (mathematically-inclined) students in data science (undergrad or grad):* it can serve as a mathematical companion to machine learning and statistics courses.

Content-wise it is a **second course** in **linear algebra, probability and vector calculus** motivated by and illustrated on **data science applications**. 
As such, students are expected to be familiar with the basics of linear algebra and probability, as well as to have been exposed to proofs. 
Moreover, while the emphasis will be on the mathematical concepts, students enrolling in this class should be willing to learn the programming language [Julia](https://julialang.org/).
