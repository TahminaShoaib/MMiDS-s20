## Final Project

Your final project consists in writing a tutorial on a machine learning method (from a list posted on Piazza). Your target audience is someone who has taken Math 535. It should take the form of a single Jupyter notebook with the following sections being required:

1. *Introduction:* general background on the problem

1. *Theory:* mathematical details of the method

1. *Implementation:* your own Julia implementation of the method

1. *Data:* choose one or two relevant datasets (simulated or real), either from the course or from somewhere else (e.g. Kaggle), to illustrate your code

1. *References:* make sure to acknowledge any material you used

There is no strict page limit. But you should aim for 10-15 pages when converted into a PDF. It will be due on the last day of classes. I will post instructions on Canvas on how to upload it. You can work individually or in a team of 2-3 students. I encourage you to work in teams. There is also a special post on the Piazza board to help you find teammates. You will be asked to provide progress reports every couple weeks. I will post the details separately.
