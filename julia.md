## Julia programming

There will be several programming assignments in [Julia](https://julialang.org/). The basics of the language will be discussed in class.

To install Julia and Jupyter notebooks, follow these [instructions](https://datatofish.com/add-julia-to-jupyter/).

Some resources for learning Julia:

- A good place to start is this [tutorial](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/10/comprehensive-tutorial-learn-data-science-julia-from-scratch/).

- A more in-depth, but still quick, overview is this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h8rQyEpiZA&t).

- If you are already familiar with MATLAB or Python, this [cheatsheet](https://cheatsheets.quantecon.org/) is useful.

- If you do not have much programming experience, this [textbook](https://benlauwens.github.io/ThinkJulia.jl/latest/book.html) may be helpful.
